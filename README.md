# Dics_for_Russian_AD
The first thing every penetration tester performs getting into a controller domain subnet is to brute force discovery of users which is called a Kerbrute attack. There are plenty of articles about that type of exploitation but in every source an author uses a preset dictionary for his purposes which is no so perfectly related to the real life. I tried to fill this gap by creating a universal working dictionary for Kerbrute attack in the Russian AD.
